# Stms

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.2.

Run `npm start`

Provided APIs don't work without API keys, so I used available free options.

@Edo:
2 routes, 2 providers, collected favorites, variable column headers, checkboxes, material design, sorting, pagination, comments - hope I didn't miss anything important.

Possible improvements: State can be normalized (but I consider it premature optimization at this point), error handling should be done properly.
